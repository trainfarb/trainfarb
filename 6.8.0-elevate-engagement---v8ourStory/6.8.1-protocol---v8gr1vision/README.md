# 6.8.1 Protocol [v8gr1vision]
This section acts as the MVP (minimum viable product) for the Proof-of-Creation protocol that will be used for 432oPI and 369mPI. Bitcoin uses Proof-of-Wook, with electricity backing the value of the network. 432oPI and 369mPI communities will use Proof-of-Creation. Rather than being backed by electricity and math, Proof-of-Creation is backed by human creativity.

The 6.8.1 Director will be split up as follows:
- 6.8.1.0-transparent-paper
- 6.8.1.1-proof-of-work
