0:00 - Felix adapt sacred geometry to introduce **DEG Entrises SA Open Source through B2B Community Building**
- Started with Haiti and now transitioning to Rwanda
- Reference bubble charts about different crops in Africa (data visualization)
- Felix wants to bring that concept to DEG Entreprises SA Ltd
- Sphere Outline
  - Center - Rwanda Company Activities (Licensing, Agri Business, Agro Transformation, Product [alcohol])
    - National and Intl partners will be public and private
    - Public: Government, ministries, etc.
    - Private: Financial institutions, companies, investors
  - First entity we interacted with was lawyer to create company (SA Ltd) - registered in RWANDA
  - Next we interact with Public partner (RDB) by presenting proposal
    - RDB gives us additional tasks that we need to complete
  - There are more partners needed
- Sphere Intentions: Within each circle are subcircles - each entity can be color coded based on status - as more activites are created the bubbles grow
  - Visually show who's having a large impact towards our strategic outcomes
- Create a list of our strategic outcomes so we can clearly track who's helping us - help us focus on where we need to alocate resources to drive our outcomes
- Turn 432oPI into a living document
- 20 to 30 public (and private) partners that we need to deal with (432oPI add these to decentralization)
  - He wants to fill out progress with each partner within each bubble
- Transparent and open source because others can now get a visual view of our progress (value add to investors to stay informed)
- Example: list costa rica, different nonprofits, climate anti-fragility, etc.
- **Now that we have a project we're starting to implement let's start documenting in this way**
  - Visually see what's happening without having to go into detail too much
  - Project engineering to manage on the background
  - Stakeholders can easily see how strategic outcomes are being achieved
- Example: how do we improve our agricultural output from x to y
  - Who can help us achieve this goal?
  - We can use this visualization to lay out all stakeholders and track
- Example: climate resistant malanga or with high start value
- Each of these examples are example inputs to achieve strategic outcomes.
  - We track entities in each bubble to manage the process
- CHALLENGE: It would be hard for people to understand the full scope
  - This will allow people to focus on what interests them most
  - Help open source community see where they fit into the big picture
- Use Rwanda project as visualization so people can define how they want to play within DEG's community
  - This will be a strong protocol for how people can interact with DEG
  - Felix is iterating on 432oPI exactly as planned
- Felix has adapted these bubbles to work through the process for all steps needed to create DEG
  - Help others see how they can make this happen
  - CHALLENGE: Those who know, know...those who don't perish
  - "You gave me a way of thinking about this thing to create a community of knowledge so that anybody who has any kind of project/thought has a roadmap to get it. So, even if i share this, do I give up any secret to my company success? no. What it does is give people who are smarter or more intutitive than me of a way of looking at things to go from point a to point b and use it for their own purposes. And now they know. And all of a sudden development becomes exponential. And that's what we need because now all of a sudden." 22:00
  - 24:00 "It's never gonna affect my business or how I achieve success, but the generation coming after. now they can achieve this stff" 
- Help people clearly understand what a company wants to acomplish and where theyre starting so the supply and value chain can self organize to create symbiotic success
- 26:00 explaining how this visualization allows us to get to the cellular level
  - Let others replicate and learn, but unique DNA can never be stolen
  - Argument against traditional companies who are scared of losing control
- 28:00 he wants to add another circle to allow others to add another circle
  - "I see what you're doing. Would it be better if you guys did this"
  - 29:00 Felix came to the natural structure of the form intuitively
- TASK - Felix to send over his bubble outline
- 30:47
  - Excited to go through systematically
  - Theres a 9 bubble structure with 432oPI
  - Within each there are 3 subsets
  - Walking through them creates a clear roadmap
  - Grateful for the opportunity to work through with DEG bc agriculture most powerful force on the planet.
  - Felix is being very meticulous w very little emotion because he wants to be objective
- 31:58 Efficient with space - grateful for working with a small country
  - Meticulous with little emotion to stay objective and calculating
  - Small footprint forces us to not be wasteful
  - Large countries can be wasteful
  - Small space forces us to do a lot in a small footprint
  - Japan was forced to be efficient with their space and resources
  - If we got 50,000 hectares, we would have been more wasteful
  - With 2,000 hectares, it forces us to remember that our goal is to maximize output
  - In the beginning, our strategic outcome should be to produce a certain percentage per hectare
  - Contraint added by RDB will help us drive efficiency
  - America wastes a lot, we have a lot of room to roam and we waste the space
  - We can use this as a model for how to maximize more space in other countries
  - "What if we go through this original exercise with 2,000 hectares and we don't have the need to manage our own, and other just add on modularly...we reduce how much we need to do while still adding to the overall vision"
- 36:32 How do we implement plans and visualizations? Transparency to combat corruption - website structure (p5.js)
  - The reason we got to this point was Felix's experience since 2014
  - Some may say it didn't go well, but validation, development, and learning helped him get to this point
  - Now, if we take those lessons (without being emotional) and being strategic
  - PRAGMATIC
  - We have to be able to find the right people to work with
  - Next 2 weeks is to give RDB everything they requested
  - TODO: Felix will modfify the spheres a bit to show what he wants to create
  - Felix wants to create Macro within excel
  - Jacques suggests p5.js (OPEN SOURCE)
    - Javascript language centered around data visualization
    - Create a nested task list
    - Each bubble is a data model
    - Show how different bubbles can be shown over time
    - We can add a slider for how the project grows and evolves over time
  - 42:35 "everybody is corrupt to some level, but they try not to be"
    - This transparency can really give Rwanda a valuable tool
  - Company is 3 things
    - DEG SA LLC - America
    - DEG SA - Haiti
    - DEG SA Ltd - Rwanda
    - Use these visualizations for all different aspects of the business
  - p5.js can be a strong communication tool
- 44:18 is it even possible to steal ideas? Give control back to Africans. Open source removes mechanism for war
  - tesla cant steal what GM does, GM can't steal what ford does
  - care companies are still close minded
  - we can share this technology (432oPI) throughout the country
  - Whoever controls the DRC
    - Everything the world needs or wants is in that country (Wakanda)
  - Bringing open source to Africa can remove the mechanism that world powers use for ware
  - Open up ownership of knowledge. Nothing to fight over. Battle of creativity
  - Challenge becomes - all knowledge is there, so what can you do with it
  - Show process for how to get from point A to point B
  - Everything you want to do is there, so we can just help people build off of each other
