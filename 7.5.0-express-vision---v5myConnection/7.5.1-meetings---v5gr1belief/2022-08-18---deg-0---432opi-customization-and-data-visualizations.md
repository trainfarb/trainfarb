This is a fantastic conversation that highlights the overall vision with 432oPI. Get people to the point where they understand the vision so they can customize and enhance its features. Felix introduces a path towards commercialization. We'll be working on 3 main strategic outcomes with this case study:
1. Commercialize DEG's Visualization Process
2. Commercialize 432oPI by showing DEG's natural adaptation
3. Commercialize hu3agency/trainfarb's Semplice/p5.js services

Timestamps
0:00 - Felix adapt sacred geometry to introduce **DEG Entrises SA Open Source through B2B Community Building**
- Started with Haiti and now transitioning to Rwanda
- Reference bubble charts about different crops in Africa (data visualization)
- Felix wants to bring that concept to DEG Entreprises SA Ltd
- Sphere Outline
  - Center - Rwanda Company Activities (Licensing, Agri Business, Agro Transformation, Product [alcohol])
    - National and Intl partners will be public and private
    - Public: Government, ministries, etc.
    - Private: Financial institutions, companies, investors
  - First entity we interacted with was lawyer to create company (SA Ltd) - registered in RWANDA
  - Next we interact with Public partner (RDB) by presenting proposal
    - RDB gives us additional tasks that we need to complete
  - There are more partners needed
- Sphere Intentions: Within each circle are subcircles - each entity can be color coded based on status - as more activites are created the bubbles grow
  - Visually show who's having a large impact towards our strategic outcomes
- Create a list of our strategic outcomes so we can clearly track who's helping us - help us focus on where we need to alocate resources to drive our outcomes
- Turn 432oPI into a living document
- 20 to 30 public (and private) partners that we need to deal with (432oPI add these to decentralization)
  - He wants to fill out progress with each partner within each bubble
- Transparent and open source because others can now get a visual view of our progress (value add to investors to stay informed)
- Example: list costa rica, different nonprofits, climate anti-fragility, etc.
- **Now that we have a project we're starting to implement let's start documenting in this way**
  - Visually see what's happening without having to go into detail too much
  - Project engineering to manage on the background
  - Stakeholders can easily see how strategic outcomes are being achieved
- Example: how do we improve our agricultural output from x to y
  - Who can help us achieve this goal?
  - We can use this visualization to lay out all stakeholders and track
- Example: climate resistant malanga or with high start value
- Each of these examples are example inputs to achieve strategic outcomes.
  - We track entities in each bubble to manage the process
- CHALLENGE: It would be hard for people to understand the full scope
  - This will allow people to focus on what interests them most
  - Help open source community see where they fit into the big picture
- Use Rwanda project as visualization so people can define how they want to play within DEG's community
  - This will be a strong protocol for how people can interact with DEG
  - Felix is iterating on 432oPI exactly as planned
- Felix has adapted these bubbles to work through the process for all steps needed to create DEG
  - Help others see how they can make this happen
  - CHALLENGE: Those who know, know...those who don't perish
  - "You gave me a way of thinking about this thing to create a community of knowledge so that anybody who has any kind of project/thought has a roadmap to get it. So, even if i share this, do I give up any secret to my company success? no. What it does is give people who are smarter or more intutitive than me of a way of looking at things to go from point a to point b and use it for their own purposes. And now they know. And all of a sudden development becomes exponential. And that's what we need because now all of a sudden." 22:00
  - 24:00 "It's never gonna affect my business or how I achieve success, but the generation coming after. now they can achieve this stff" 
- Help people clearly understand what a company wants to acomplish and where theyre starting so the supply and value chain can self organize to create symbiotic success
- 26:00 explaining how this visualization allows us to get to the cellular level
  - Let others replicate and learn, but unique DNA can never be stolen
  - Argument against traditional companies who are scared of losing control
- 28:00 he wants to add another circle to allow others to add another circle
  - "I see what you're doing. Would it be better if you guys did this"
  - 29:00 Felix came to the natural structure of the form intuitively
- TASK - Felix to send over his bubble outline
- 30:47
  - Excited to go through systematically
  - Theres a 9 bubble structure with 432oPI
  - Within each there are 3 subsets
  - Walking through them creates a clear roadmap
  - Grateful for the opportunity to work through with DEG bc agriculture most powerful force on the planet.
  - Felix is being very meticulous w very little emotion because he wants to be objective
- 31:58 Efficient with space - grateful for working with a small country
  - Meticulous with little emotion to stay objective and calculating
  - Small footprint forces us to not be wasteful
  - Large countries can be wasteful
  - Small space forces us to do a lot in a small footprint
  - Japan was forced to be efficient with their space and resources
  - If we got 50,000 hectares, we would have been more wasteful
  - With 2,000 hectares, it forces us to remember that our goal is to maximize output
  - In the beginning, our strategic outcome should be to produce a certain percentage per hectare
  - Contraint added by RDB will help us drive efficiency
  - America wastes a lot, we have a lot of room to roam and we waste the space
  - We can use this as a model for how to maximize more space in other countries
  - "What if we go through this original exercise with 2,000 hectares and we don't have the need to manage our own, and other just add on modularly...we reduce how much we need to do while still adding to the overall vision"
- 36:32 How do we implement plans and visualizations? Transparency to combat corruption - website structure (p5.js)
  - The reason we got to this point was Felix's experience since 2014
  - Some may say it didn't go well, but validation, development, and learning helped him get to this point
  - Now, if we take those lessons (without being emotional) and being strategic
  - PRAGMATIC
  - We have to be able to find the right people to work with
  - Next 2 weeks is to give RDB everything they requested
  - TODO: Felix will modfify the spheres a bit to show what he wants to create
  - Felix wants to create Macro within excel
  - Jacques suggests p5.js (OPEN SOURCE)
    - Javascript language centered around data visualization
    - Create a nested task list
    - Each bubble is a data model
    - Show how different bubbles can be shown over time
    - We can add a slider for how the project grows and evolves over time
  - 42:35 "everybody is corrupt to some level, but they try not to be"
    - This transparency can really give Rwanda a valuable tool
  - Company is 3 things
    - DEG SA LLC - America
    - DEG SA - Haiti
    - DEG SA Ltd - Rwanda
    - Use these visualizations for all different aspects of the business
  - p5.js can be a strong communication tool
- 44:18 is it even possible to steal ideas? Give control back to Africans. Open source removes mechanism for war. 
  - tesla cant steal what GM does, GM can't steal what ford does
  - care companies are still close minded
  - we can share this technology (432oPI) throughout the country
  - Whoever controls the DRC
    - Everything the world needs or wants is in that country (Wakanda)
  - Bringing open source to Africa can remove the mechanism that world powers use for ware
  - Open up ownership of knowledge. Nothing to fight over. Battle of creativity
  - Challenge becomes - all knowledge is there, so what can you do with it
  - Show process for how to get from point A to point B
  - Everything you want to do is there, so we can just help people build off of each other
- 46:46 Hidden knowledge keeps people dependent - leaders keep knwoledge from us - open source changes this dynamic
  - Has list of national organizations involved
  - Put them all in appropriate bubbles so people can see where they connect
  - A new company uses the same process with a similar map
  - Then as things play out over the years, it'll all be connected
  - Not creating connections...uncovering connections that are already there
  - As people catch on to what open source communities are doing, it'll be a transformative shift for everyone
  - Bring power to people
  - Everyone is different - not everyone wants to be business owners
  - We have a need for one another
  - Murderers need victims. Victims need victimizers
  - Sellers need purchasers
  - CHALLENGE: knowledge is private and hidden, so we're always dependent on "leaders" and they manipulate us (this is why 432oPI is focused on bringing knowledge for institutions so we can control things)
  - This is what Felix was trying to do in Haiti - bring knowledge back to people, but forces were greater than he anticipated - 432oPI is a new approach to his existing idea
  - 432oPI gives people a new way to approach their existing ideas. fresh eyes on your core idea
- 49:49 Creating a library. Library that helps people get to commercialization.
  - Proposal (1XX pages) took something out of him
  - Now we're in a place where we can start implementing
  - Seeing the 432oPI structure allowed him to use his project implementation experience (lab to marketplace) within the open source structure
  - Using experience from DOW chemical and apply it to the 432oPI
  - Internet makes it so much easier to share knowledge
  - We're creating an open source agricultural library for others to navigate
  - Now that Felix created the proposal, summarizing the proposal
    - Went from 30k view to 15k view
    - TASK: now he's working on the nitty gritty
  - What will it take for the rubber to meet the road?
  - Commerialization is the goal
  - Here's the process
    - Start with idea
    - Analyze problem
    - Validate problem
    - Develop Solution
    - Implement solution
    - Commercialize solution
- 54:55 Where are we now towards commercialization?
  - Took everything we learned over last 8 years to create proposal
  - Put proposal into implementation stage
  - RDB told us to move back to development stage to phase out test before implementing before they feel fully comfortable
  - All DEG 432oPI projects follow the same path towards commercialization
  - Recap commercialization and list it out visually over the same 7 circle sphere
  - Commercialization is the center sphere (v7myJourney)
    - It's the purpose of everything
  - PURPOSE FOR ALL 432oPI BRANDS IS COMMERCIALIZATION
- 59:20 Jacques Runthrough GitHub process and its benefits
  - Originally showed Notion for project management
  - Notion makes it hard of us to own and extract the data
  - It'll be expensive and GitHub will be a great free resource
  - Process on GitHub walkthrough
  - Clone 432oPI and focus it all around commercialization based on Felix's experience
  - Create structure, track meetings, etc
- 1:04:50 How do we structure things in DEG's github to start out?
  - Two active companies right now
  - RWANDA and USA
  - DEG Haiti isn't functioning right now
  - Rwanda is what we're building
  - Start filling in Felix's systematic process
- 1:06:55 Symbiotic relationship between tracking and implementation
  - We already have vast majority of info in github table of contents
  - Felix already has roadmap for everything
  - All we have to do now is fit things into a systematic process
  - Jacques understood big picture of what needs to be done without necessairly knowling the implementation
  - Jacques understood the outline to get a project done and Felix has extensive implementation experience
  - Jacques knows how to track and Felix knows how to implement
  - Symbiotic relationship
- 1:11:00 432oPI relational database for DEG process
  - Translational database so different communities can 
  - Introduce coding system with quantum memoir example
  - Create a new row for DEG to help people who want to work towards commercialization
  - Start with simple breakdown of each step in the process (case studies)
  - TASK: In the future, create substeps for each step in the commercialization process
- 1:17:40 What phase are we in? How do different communities line up with one another
  - We're in development working towards getting into implementation
  - When different communities have their own structure and communication style, they'll be able to jump from community to community while still understanding what's going on
- 1:20:35
  - Felix to keep working on bubble outline
  - Jacques to take what he's doing to lay it into the system
  - 432oPI allows professionals to visually lay out their process and line up with other communities who can help them grow faster
  - Allow people to work on themselves without having to work with the broader community
- 1:22:00 Next steps
  - Jacques - create one repository for DEG SA Ltd (Rwanda)
    - Get this one set and then copy it over
  - Felix - focus on DEG SA Ltd (Rwanda) first and then apply lessons to vodka
  - Felix - still working on vodka, but in the background
  - Stay pragmatic with how we work through the repository
  - Not going to costa rica right now so we can focus
- 1:28:44 Expressing desire for open source
  - Want the visualization on the website
  - Sees website as being two parts
    - One part can be semplice
    - the other can be a subdomain to a react application
