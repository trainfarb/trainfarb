# 0.7.0 Onboarding - DEFINE Purpose - v7myJourney  
#### Introduce what the meeting's about

Create Portfolio presentation slides that serve two purposes:
- Present the value provided to people who complete the course (slider that introduces the course)
- Present the responses someone comes up with after completing the course (result of the course)

# 1.1.0 Community Plan - GROUND Operations - v1ourHome  
#### Outline how this fits into the big picture

- This will become an outline that can easily become a website/presentation for a person's vocation

# 2.0.0 Project Brief - INITIATE Mission - v0ourSource
#### Summarize the meeting and outcomes. 

- Challenge: it's difficult to concisely describe what someone gets from an offering
- Inspiration: the intro slides that introduce apps always give a lot of content with a single sentence on each slide
- Willpower: People can use this format to introduce the courses they make as derivatives of sOl 369mPI
