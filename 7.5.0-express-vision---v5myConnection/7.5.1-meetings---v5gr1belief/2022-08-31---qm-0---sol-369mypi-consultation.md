Below are the notes from the 8/31 Meeting
#### QM Purpose (ecology):
- Create a collective of poeple who think quantumly
- Quantum Me Collective - people demonstrating their lifestyle philosophy to inspire others. Recipes
- "I want to help people develop their own life philosophy"
- Focus on a lifestyle philosophy to help people move into a progressive evolution
- Philosophies people create within the ecosystem don't compete. They complement
- Symbiosis

#### QM Ground (decentralization):
- Once upon a time, QM created positive waves of change in the **self develop industry**, and humanity positively evolved
- Self Development Industry
- Positive Evolution
- "DIY Guide to Evolution"
- Humans need to actively participate in the evolution of our consciousness 
- **Decentralize the lifestyle design system (life philosophy) so they're not living the one that was given to them**

#### QM Intend (relate):
- We are creators and manifestors
- Intention "we are"
- Design "Creators and manifestors"
- Help people recognize that they/we are creators, and through that act of creation, we manifest our life philosophy (intentionally or unintentionally)
- If you're not behind the wheel, somebody else is, and you're in the passenger seat of your own life
- **We are all part of the same life form.**

#### QM Observe (shadow):
- People started to noh thyself
- People don't really know themselves and they can do a lot better in designing their lives
- People started to know themselves and generate new meaning with words and symbols
- Shadow: 
  - People only know who they've told to be
  - There are programmed conditions (challenge to be overcome)
- Presence: 
  - QM Thought form is one point
  - Adopt the discernment of the observer perspective
- Music (sound/communication/interaction):
  - Sharing thought form with the collective opens things up for feedback
  - QM Collective is the music to help people get out of their own head
  - Taking away programmed thought, emotions, triggers, and anything that will get in the way of solutions/progressive actions
  - Interact with the QM Collective
  - Put yourself in the environments who allow you to view yourself objectively
  - Human connection
  - **Emenation**

#### QM Connect (Create):
- Biomimicry of nature
- Biggest biomimicry in QM is the time cycle
- Problems are happening over and over again just like summer
- **Creating rhythm**
- Create a rhythm for yourself: it doesn't have to be monday through friday/9-5

#### QM Express (How do you want people to share?):
- People sharing their authentic vulnerability
- Whatever fears people have about sharing their truths, nothing bad will happen from it
- In a very "visual and tangible" way
- People don't want to share bc they think it takes away from the magic
- QM Collective is about owning it all
- Thought form with **ponderings**
- Express
  - Belief: Thought Form
  - Science: Citations
  - Sensemaking: Pondering - translate belief into a context someone else can understand

#### QM Refine (mythology):
- Once people share their vulnerable story, they'll be demonstrating rhythm (rhyme/reason) of what they leanred and how to derive lessons from things
- If we're living in a resonable world, others will be able to adopt that
- Refer to 
- Holy Man (movie)
- Truman Show (movie)
- Idiocracy (movie)
