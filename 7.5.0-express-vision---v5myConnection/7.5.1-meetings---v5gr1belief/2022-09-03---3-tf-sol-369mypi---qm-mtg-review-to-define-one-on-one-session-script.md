- Watch video and record notes of how it went
- Meeting Notes
  - Jacques asked what next steps are
  - MaLee doesn't know what next steps are for her professionally and personally
  - tf wants to apply everything with ourStory to QM
  - Shared screen to run through tf's ideas
    - Want to approach every problem into 10 diff sections
    - Define overall mission - adapt QM creation cycle to help people define vocation (sOl 369myPI) so tf can practice devrel skills to turn their courses into vocational onramps
      - What would be QM's creation cycle? create a foundation of equilibrium/centeredness for evolution and growth
      - ***This will be about QM's specific case study for Creation Cycle
    - Community Plan Definition - sOl 369myPI wants to decentralize devrel industry to positive self talk is more accessible to combat self censorship
      - 7:30 MaLee recognized that we're essentially going through the creation cycle
      - She found her previous thought form for creation cycle (this is where her intuition starts to affect the call)
      - 7:40 MaLee recognized we come up with loose ideas after visual thought form, this is where we dive deeper into Creation Cycle after
      - 8:30 I'm helping MaLee hone into what she did during the brainstorming session
      - 8:50 We dive in visually, then do one on one session
      - 9:15 Her suggestion aligns with the breakdown of Public courses, Symbiotic sessions, and cohort based courses
      - 9:30 We've done the public course together, now this meeting is becoming the 
    - 10:00 Introduce the 10 slide deck that I created that will capture people's responses
      - 11:00 identifying that after this meeting, I'll turn her responses into a deck
- 11:30 MaLee met with Podia (her website) the day before our call - $100 a month for the website and she needs to recoup that.
  - MaLee wants to work with me to help her unlock value
  - She sees the value in me asking her questions to get her ideas out more
  - 12:40 we go through the sOl 369myPI course together in a Symbiotic Session so I can help her see things she can't see
  - 13:00 I want to help her get to a point where she can explain the Creation Cycle in a similar fashion so she can extract more value
  - 13:27 Me and Nohemy can start creating ecosystem marketing for her and start building a community
  - 13:45 Creation cycle is a free course, but we can explore how. Brainstorm before going into creation cycle. "like an employee review"
- 14:30 - MaLee has me intuitively jump into the Symbiotic Session
  - Pull up thought form from her sOl 369myPI
  - Purpose - she wants the courses to be part of the collective and the collective to be part of the courses
    - 15:50 Creating a collective of people who think quantumly
    - The Purpose is Quantum Me Collective
    - 17:00 She doesn't want it to sound like a religion
    - 17:15 every company is a religion in a sense - it's a word
    - 17:35 tapping into someones essence and help change their belief systems is a sensitive subject
    - 18:30 Quantum MeMoir isn't imposing new beliefs on others. It's helping people define their own beliefs. It's the only thing that freed me up with ourStory and huStory. People already have their beliefs. People are rubbed the wrong way with religion. QM didn't give me the sense of anything being pushed on me. Peoples thoughts are always all over the place, and stepping into Quantum Me Collective provides a revolution of time that people can dip in and out whenever it works for them. "Me joining the Quantum Me Collective feels like it's all about me. It doesn't feel like I'm listening to MaLee preech"
    - 20:00 Quantum Me Collective feels like a way for people to create their own religion for themselves
    - 20:20 "I want to help people develop their own life philosphy" - everyone can have a truth and they can all be separate - THIS IS THE PURPOSE
    - 20:50 All sharing the recipes of our lifestyle philosophies
    - 21:20 Jacques - woke up with the desire to bring in some structure. I was saying how I wanted different recipes. I have so many different ways I like to live my life. Would be great to be able to choose company, lazy day, etc. Quantum Me Collective can be a great way for people to create recipes for "Choose your own adventures"
    - 22:40 MaLee - most authors feel they have the answers to everything, but ultimately people find what helps them. Quantum Me Collective helps people find the thing that works for them. "That's why it's an open system"
  - GROUND - "Once upon a time, Quantum made positive waves of change in the self development industry and humanity positively evolved"
    - 24:00 Self Development Industry
    - 24:30 "How do I make that real and tangible"
    - MaLee identified that she's making positive changes in ourStory and others
    - She wants to create it on a larger scale
    - 25:15 - the best way to make this tangible is by building on the previous step. She wants to help people create their own life philosophy, 
      - 25:50 - her original tagline was Your DIY Guide to Personal Evolution.
      - 26:00 - plants and animals don't need to do anything to evolve, but humans do need to take a more active role in our evolution
      - Society is doing the de-evolution of us through movies and food, so it's on us to consciously evolve so we don't slip into the vacuum of consumerism
      - 27:20 Humans are an expression of consciousness. We have more free will than animals, so we have conscious choice. Even though trees and animals are an expresson of consciousness, but ever second we have an infinite number of ways to go. We can choose to select the path of least resistance with consumerism. Poeple don't understand why they fall into depression. With Quantum MeMoir, if people are feeling out of balance, they can tune into their personal resonant frequency with the revolution of time, so people can get themselves out of autopilot.
      - 25:40 most people are given a few options to life, and when they choose one it doesn't actually align with them QM gives people an open way to design their own path
      - 29:15 MaLee hasn't expressed the statements of the challenges. She needs to get fired up about what's happening. She doesn't pull that type of character out of her. She feels she needs to act as if she does know things that others don't know
      - She feels she needs to be a character, but she doesn't like how others do it
      - 30:30 What I've drawn from us interacting is that MaLee has negative reactions to marketing and advertising, but I also have negative interactions to how people have to choose lifestyles. My recommendation is that MaLee needs to do marketing and advertising. Want her to create something new. Let's dive into the shadow of what what rubs her the wrong way and not do them.
      - 31:45 She was showing resistence when talking to MaLee
      - She didn't know how to express her own marketing vision because she's been choosing to be ignorant
      - 32:20 Example that tesla doesn't have marketing budget, but they have their own way to do it. We can do something similar for Quantum MeMoir
    - 33:00 GROUND/INITIATE MaLee wants to dive into the value of ecosystem marketing. Decentralizing how to design lifestyle philosopies, because if they don't they're falling into 
  - INTEND 34:30 "We are creators and manifestors"
    - 35:40 - help people identify that they/we are all creators/god and through that act of creation we all manifest our experience, and if we're not intentionally doing it, we're doing it based on what someone else has told them
    - 36:30 - identifying she needs to be more controversial in her branding - too subtle for people who need to hear it
    - 37:00 - become more provocative. people should start voting after they've actually created something
    - Use provacative for good - she already knows how to use that
    - 38:30 - What do we want to draw out of the intend sphere?
    - 39:00 - each sphere within sOl 369myPI is broken into 3 diff sections. Within this symbiotic session, we dial into the first subsection of the sphere
      - Our philosphies complement one another
      - This is where Symbiotic Session came from - MaLee's musing here
    - Purpose focuses on first aspect (ecology)
    - Ground focuses on (decentalization)
    - INTEND is related to (relate)
    - 42:00 INTEND Takewaway is that we are all one - same lifeform
  - OBSERVE 42:20 - focus will be the shadow
    - 43:00 shes saying people won't know themselves unless they work through purpose, ground, and intend
    - 44:40 - all other sphere focus on just the first section, but this one dives into all 3
      - shadow, presence, and music (content strategy)
      - shadow: people only know who they've been told to be. Challenge to overcome is that there are programmed conditions
        - In order to know yourself, you need to identify that you're programmed conditions and you'll need to break them if you don't like them
      - Presence: How do you find presence to look at your shadow effectively? Can you find some peace looking at your shadow without having to do anything
        - Enter the observer perspective. Step out of your persona. "we're not these people...we're the observer observing these people"
        - Adopt discernment of the observer perspective
        - 49:00 ***How do you want people to adopt discernment?***
        - PRESENCE: Put yourself in the environments that queue this for you. Join the Quantum MeMoir collective
        - If we're in the Quantum MeMoir collective, it's through talking.
        - How do we connect with people in presence if they don't already subscribe to the methodology?
        - 51:30 if you only have two points of view, you only know where you are
        - ***Presence comes from perspective of the Quantum Me Collective***
      - Shadow: Programmed conditions, people only know who they've been told to be
      - Presence: QM Thought form allows people to be still with themselves and connect with their shadow
      - Music: Putting thought form into the collective to allow ideas to emenate
      - 53:00 - explaining the value in sharing Quantum MeMoir thought forms publicly
      - 54:20 - collective is so important because it takes you out of your own head
  - 56:15 CONNECT
    - Biggest biomimicry within Quantum MeMoir is the revolution of Time
    - People don't realize that their problems are opening over and over again just like summer
    - They're living in the habitual past with new characters and players of situation, but the same issue
    - Create, Gratitude, and Manifest
    - **Quantum MeMoir is creating Rhythm**
    - Can we create a very simple work book for Quantum MeMoir Cretion cycle
    - ***Turn this into an instagram carousel that will grab people's attentions***
    - Use her story to introduce ourStory and Quantum Me Collective
  - 1:00:00 EXPRESS
    - About people sharing their authentic vulnerablity
    - People have thoughts in their mind and tell others, but people can't really connect with it
    - 1:01:30 "This is where it's hardest for QM to grow and earn money"
    - People are scared to share their goals bc of philosophies of magic
    - QM Collective beleives the most powerful thing you can do is own it all and share
    - If we're in the QM Collective and part of the same life form, you sharing your idea isn't sharing with others. If you're living in the thought form that there are others, then it take away from the magic, but in the QM Collective there are no others, so sharing is a benefit to people who join.
    - 1:04:00 Recognize that everyone is you. If they hate on your ideas, what can you learn from their negative or positive feedback to speed up your progress. This is Q.Me Philosphy
    - How do you want people to share?
      - Do you want people to share thought forms?
      - Do you want people to share with videos?
      - Do you want people to share case studies?
      - ***MaLee wants people to share ponderings***
        - Share thought form, citations
        - Best case scenario, share visual thought form with a pondering with text links that support the thought form
        - Belief, science, and sensemaking
        - What are my straight up beleifs?
        - What research am I doing to give context to my beliefs
        - Based on beleifs and research
      - ***This is how people share***
        - Belief - thought form
        - Science - Citations
        - Sensemaking - Ponderings
  - 1:08:00 REFINE
    - Once people share their visual/tangible story, they're be demonstrating rhythm, rhyme, and reason of the lessons they've learned and how to derive lessons from other things they experience
    - If we're living in a world where more people practice rhyme and reason, others will be able to adopt that
    - 3 aspects of refine are Mythology, Spirituality, and Consiciousness
      - 1:11:00 MaLee running through the mythology
      - Can someone read the short outline of the mythology and be inspired to want to share
      - There's not compelling around the United States, but listening to the overview of QM makes me excited to get more involved
      - 1:15:00 - MaLee will ask "What is your story?" and if they don't have a good answer, they can come up with a new one with the Quantum MeMoir Collective. This gives people a clear way to answer the story.
      - 1:16:00 - Mythology is where you want to go and how you want it to feel. Want to make sure people don't achieve their goals at all cost
      - Use mythology as a qualitative test to see if we're actually living the way we want to live
      - Recommend Eddie Murphy movie Holy Man
      - Truman Show - living in fake world and we don't realize it
      - Idiocracy
    - If you want other people to understand
  - 1:10:00 Ecosystem Marketing
    - This is an example of how people can share their own experience within the Quantum Me Collective
    - trainfarb creates a series of memes with Holy Man and create marketing material on Quantum Me's behalf to promote her work
    - People aren't really content creators
    - MaLee identified that she'll need to teach people how to teach marketing so people in the community can market for them
    - Introduce what the 4th course in the Quantum MeMoir course will focus on
- 1:20:00 I didn't realize this meeting needed to be a part of sOl 369myPI
  - It's not that people don't want to learn we weren't taught how to learn
  - People weren't given a topic of how to learn
  - sOl 369myPI puts the focus on individuals. Makes you the focus and then you'll be inspired to learn anything you need to make your life a reality
- 1:24:00
  - Testimonial from MaLee
- Add photo of thought form
- 1:26:00 TSOBTC
  - Showed them what we've been working on
  - Want to figure out a way that we can tag team 
  - MaLee identified that she's the brainstorming portion, then they can have one-on-one consultations to help people bring more form to their idea
  - MaLee bring magical and playful vibes
  - trainfarb 
  - Start with Quantum MeMoir Creation Cycle to tap into energy and space
  - Then refine that version with canva
  - Third is a step with this symbiotic session to solidify plans into an NFT for ourStory  
- Break all of this up into shorter videos clips in the next go around
