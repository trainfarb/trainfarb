Daily goals structure can be the same as quarterly goals. |

|              |            | "Earth, 114 million years ago, one morning just after sunrise: The first flower ever to appear on the planet opens up to receive the rays of the sun. Prior to this momentous event that heralds an evolutionary transformation in the life of plants, the planet had already been covered in vegetation for millions of years. The first flower probably did not survive for long, and flowers must have remained rare and isolated phenomena, since conditions were most likely not yet favorable for widespread flowering to occur. One day, however, a criticl threshold was reached, and suddenly there would have been an explosion of color and scent al over the planet---if a perceiving consciousness had been there to witness it."

| 7.5.1 Sessions |  v5gr1belief | Humans today are at a similar point that flowers were 114 million years ago. Small numbers of us are flowering and speaking out against our own self-censorship to define our own vocations, but conditions are still against it socially. Things are starting to change and we're getting close to a critical threshold. |
| 7.5.2 Research |  v5gr2science | [Research based on my belief] [Find statistics about people's satisfaction at work] [find data about self-censorship] |

|  |  v6gr0song | "This is America" by Childish Gambino |
| 8.6.1 Worldbuilding |  v6gr1mythology | [How does book quote inspire the mythology?] Ego has permeated from our institutions into each of our minds. Top down censorship has translated into inside out censorship. Self-censorship keeps us as standard vegetation, but as we improve our positive self talk and start to speak our truth regardless of fear of pushback or cancellation, we all begin to flower within huStory. |
