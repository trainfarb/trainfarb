ELEVATE Engagement [v8ourPurpose]:
- trainfarb: "Conversations are dynamic, interactive, and inclusive. They evolve and impact the way we connect, engage, interact, and influence others, enabling us to shape reality, mind-sets, events, and outcomes in a collaborative way. Conversations have the power to move us from "power over" others to "power with" others, giving us the exquisite ability to get on the same page with out fellow humans and experience the same reality by bridging the reality gaps between "how you see things and how I see things." Conversational Intelligence by Judith E. Glaser
  - Are we using conversations to bridge or broaden reality gaps?
