## EXPRESS Vision [v5myConnection]:
- [2022-09-08---deg-hu3---investor-pitch-deck---defining-structure.md](https://www.loom.com/share/9880f89456084f16aa0405836ca61d52)
- Watch [How to Create a Pitch Deck for Investors in 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SB16xgtFmco) by Slidebean to define pitch outline
  - Introduction: Present case, problem, premise, and proposed solution. Can you capture their attention?
    - Cover
    - Problem: present status quo. Can this be synthesized into a single sentence to outline a problem that will act as a good intro for the proposed solutions in the next step? Make it down to earth. No jargon. Create empathy with investors. Can the problem be applied to the investor?
    - Solution: mention 3 or 4 core functions that address the problems. Promote benefits instead of features.
  - Product Demo: How can we present the product to them? Can this reach the aha moment for them?
  - Market Size: How large can the company become? Top down or bottom up market approach?
  - Business Model: Makes or breaks the pitch. Show how you make money in the simplest way. % of transaction? etc.
  - Competition: Compare product to competitors in a 4 quadrant matrix
  - Underlying Magic: What technology or strategy makes this unique?
  - Go-to Market: Refer to plans for acquiring a community? Fake it til you make it. Prove you can be creative about ways to grow the business. 3 or more strategies.
  - Team: Mention founders and why they're the ideal to make this happen. Hustler (CEO), Hacker (CTO), Hipster (Branding). Don't talk about advisors or first employees.
  - Traction/Milestones: Crucial part of the pitch. Might need to be first if pitching. This is the climax of the story. If you don't have sales, should you pitch investors?
  - Fundraising Information: How much money are you raising? There are regulations about where you can share this for non-accredited investors.
