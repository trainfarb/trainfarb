- Watch [How to Create a Pitch Deck for Investors in 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SB16xgtFmco) by Slidebean to define pitch outline
  - Introduction: Present case, problem, premise, and proposed solution. Can you capture their attention?
    - 1 Cover
    - 2 Problem: present status quo. Can this be synthesized into a single sentence to outline a problem that will act as a good intro for the proposed solutions in the next step? Make it down to earth. No jargon. Create empathy with investors. Can the problem be applied to the investor?
    - 3 Solution: mention 3 or 4 core functions that address the problems. Promote benefits instead of features.
  - 4 Product Demo: How can we present the product to them? Can this reach the aha moment for them?
  - 5 Market Size: How large can the company become? Top down or bottom up market approach?
  - 6 Business Model: Makes or breaks the pitch. Show how you make money in the simplest way. % of transaction? etc.
  - 7 Competition: Compare product to competitors in a 4 quadrant matrix
  - 8 Underlying Magic: What technology or strategy makes this unique?
  - 9 Go-to Market: Refer to plans for acquiring a community? Fake it til you make it. Prove you can be creative about ways to grow the business. 3 or more strategies.
  - 10 Team: Mention founders and why they're the ideal to make this happen. Hustler (CEO), Hacker (CTO), Hipster (Branding). Don't talk about advisors or first employees.
  - 11 Traction/Milestones: Crucial part of the pitch. Might need to be first if pitching. This is the climax of the story. If you don't have sales, should you pitch investors?
  - 12 Fundraising Information: How much money are you raising? There are regulations about where you can share this for non-accredited investors.

- [Investor Pitch Deck: The ultimate guide by Slidebean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iu8d2Kd8e4o)
  - Pitch decks, not biz plans get companies funded
  - First impression: need to look good
  - Art/science/story
  - Deck should do three things
    - Tell your COMPANY STORY
    - Convince and investory that they can make MONEY with the company
    - Achieve this in under 4 minutes
  - Most common problem seen
    - People getting caught up in details
  - Most angel investors expect a standard pitch deck, so give them what they expect so it's easier for them to consume
    - Act 2 - Rising action, stakes get high, and plot point 2
      - 
      - 
      - Story climax comes after plot point 2
      - Plot point 2 narrows things down
      - Plot point 2 varries depending on business
        - Traction slide because we tapped into an incredible distribution channel?
        - Highlight how competitors foolishly overlooked something our team knows?
        - Team, background, and experience?
      - Plot point 2 (climax) is when viewer is most vulnerable, and it's after this when we can ask for money
      - Remember: Pitch deck is a summary of a companies story
        - If structured in the right way
        - Act 3 will be about giving arguments about why the company is incredible
      - Slides, slide order, and story are less important than answering the question of fundraising
        - 
        - 
        - 
      - Does the deck answer these questions? Founders often get lost in the technicalities, business models and projects, when we should answer those set of questions in under 4 minutes
    - Three Act Structure
      - ACT 1: Setup
        - Act 1 is our _Introduction_: Introduce our character and the status quo
        - **SLIDE 1: COVER**
          - 5-7 word description of what you do
          - simple, self explanatory, so simple you can read it without trying
          - not a marketing tagline
          - explain what company does
        - **SLIDE 1.1 TABLE OF CONTENTS / BRIEF TRACTION**
        - **SLIDE 2: STATUS QUO/PROBLEM**
          - Make a believable picture of the current world
          - Problem/business opportunity slide - most companies solve global problems
          - Can you point out a problem people and investors have been experiencing that's so obvious they haven't seen it yet
          - Getting this wrong can make deck fall apart
          - If investors disagree with this you'll lose them
            - Ex. Many pitchers will say "social media is boring" - what if investor loves social media?
          - What's happening and how does it need to change?
          - Present a universe we can believe in.
          - What's the tea?
          - What's happening in the world today?
          - What are the flaws?
        - **SLIDE 3: SOLUTION**
          - The Solution is _PLOT POINT 1_
          - Mirror to the problem slide
          - The Solution slide changes the direction of the story
          - This is what disrupts the status quo
          - Plot point 1 around 1/3 of the way in
          - Great solutions slides are concise
          - Don't introduce features
          - Only present thesis: what if instead of doing things like "this" we do "this"
          - When the story takes an unexpected turn
        - _FUNDRAISING QUESTION 1 CHECKPOINT: What opportunity have you discovered in the market?_
      - ACT 2: Confrontation
        - Act 2 is our _Product Section_: Rising Action brings the hero out of our character
        - **SLIDE 4: PRODUCT Slide**
          - Video demo (make it short), how does it work diagram, or screen shots (similar to marketing landing page)
          - Product takes shape / Meeting the hero
          - How can we present the product to them?
          - Make them care about and empathize with the character/product.
          - Can this bring them to their aha moment?
        - **SLIDE 4.1: BENEFITS SLIDE**
          - Focus on Benefits instead of features
          - Don't use jargon
          - Just include real life use case scenarios that everyone will understand
        - **SLIDE 4.2: AUDIENCE/USE CASE SLIDE**
          - Focus on Benefits instead of features
          - Don't use jargon
          - Just include real life use case scenarios that everyone will understand
        - **SLIDE 4.3: UNDERLYING MAGIC**
          - What technology or strategy makes us unique?
        - _FUNDRAISING QUESTION 2 CHECKPOINT: What have we built to tackle the opportunity? How does it work? Who is it for?_
        - **SLIDE 4.4: MARKET VALIDATION / WHY NOW** 
          - Support products where adoption could be a challenge
        - **SLIDE 5: BUSINESS MODEL**
          - The Business Model is _PLOT POINT 2_
          - Many get this wrong
          - Not about projections
          - Not about how much money could be made with 1,000,000 customers
          - Only about how we make money (investors are smart)
          - The specifics will change regularly
          - What is the funding model, how much does it cost, is there a trial period?
          - Product or service? Average order size? What's the margin?
          - Is it a marketplace? 10% per purchase...done.
          - Makes or breaks the pitch
          - Show how you make money in the simplest way
        - **SLIDE 6: MILESTONES & ROADMAP FOR PRODUCT**
          - Bridge between product and how much it costs into the numbers and traction
          - Go over major highlights of product evolution and company history
          - What will company become over the next few months (not long term)
          - Not making financial projections yet
          - This is a product section still - product vision and not the numbers
      - ACT 3: Resolution
      - Act 3 is our _Competitive Landscape_: Climax of the story showing how hero will beat competitors
        - **SLIDE 11: MARKET / TRACTION / MILESTONES**
          - Crucial part of the pitch
          - This is the climax of the story
          - What was the journey to make your revenue
          - How much made in the past month
          - How much compared to month before that...and so on
          - What breakthroughs changed things for you
          - No faking a traction slide
          - If you don't have sales, should you pitch investors? Probably not.

        - **SLIDE 9: GO-TO MARKET STRATEGY**
          - Genius rollout plan
          - What have you done to get here?
          - What are you doing now to keep going?
          - What are you doing next?
          - Most funders fund 12-18 months of operations, so answer how to get to the next fundable milestone
          - There are a lot of goto market slides that lack focus
          - Everyone does SEO and Influencer marketing
          - A good Goto market slide talks about 2-3 concrete examples that are growing 
          - How will we grow a community?
          - Don't need to have all the answers here, just confidence in our plan. Fake it til we make it

          - Biz Dev
          - Can current team make everything before this happen
          - We don't raise money for form a team, we form a team to raise money
          - Don't include advisors or first employees. Show who is committed
        - _FUNDRAISING QUESTION 3 CHECKPOINT: Why are we and our team THE TEAM that can change the status quo?_

          - How much money are we raising?
          - Take note of regulations (some information can't be shared with non-accredited investors)

3 different approaches depending on context of what we're sending
- Demo Day Deck: founder's presenting. slides don't need to be self explanatory. they're supporting for what's being said. 3-5 minute time limit. presenting in front of adience, so don't share confidential information that you can't tell non-accredited investors
- Email Deck: most deals happen bc you peak the interest of investors. Don't cold email investors. When you get an intro to an investor, they'll ask them to send a pitch deck or we'll ask to take a look. This is the deck that get's us a meeting. This needs the most amount of work because it's seen by a lot of people. 
  - Needs to be self explanatory
  - Investor consumes it on their own without our voice or clarification
  - needs to look really good because it's a first impression
  - more secret sauce can be shared here since they're accredited investors
  - just tell enough to get called into the next stage of the process
  - VCs spend an average of 3-4 minutes looking at a deck
  - Don't assume you'll change people's behavior
  - If the deck can't be consumed in 3-4 minutes, chances are they'll skip over content you share and give up after a certain amount of slides
  - Short enough so they can be consumed in 4 minutes
- Meeting Deck: if the email get's you a meeting. you need this deck. It's an evolution of the email deck. Same thing with extra details
  - 5 minutes - settle'/small talk
  - 15 minutes to go through slides and company
  - 30 minutes for discussion questions and follow up
  - 4 minute self read turns into 15 minute narrated deck
- Can be challenging to manage 3 decks so many will make something close to email deck and use it for all 3
- Important to understand differences between these to avoid common mistakes like taking the same email deck to a meeting bc we're expected to bring more
- Don't use a demo day deck to send through email

          - Traction slide because we tapped into an incredible distribution channel?
          - Highlight how competitors foolishly overlooked something our team knows?
          - Team, background, and experience?
