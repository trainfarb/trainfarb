## My DevRel Job Titles (The Polymath Protocol)
Below are ways I like helping freelancers and teams develop well rounded ecosystems.  10-part system serves two purposes:
1. Help teams create DAOs and/or subDAOs with a consistent outline that promotes cross-community collaboration
2. Help freelancers understand how they can add value and grow their portfolios with a DAO using The Polymath Protocol

My aim is to use The Polymath Protocol to help you organize your ideas and present your vision so you can find a community that will help bring your ideas to life. If you are a brand/team/DAO, we'll use this framework to help you explore and grow your idea from 10 different perspectives. If you're a freelancer, we'll use this framework to identify how you can add value to existing communities using The Polymath Protocol.
