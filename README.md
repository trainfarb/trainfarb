Oh hi.  
trainfarb here.  
Gonna use this as my website I think.  
I've liked journaling since I was a kid...I blame Doug Funny.

## I would like to help you design an open source community for your idea or brand.

LinkedIn | Twitter | Instagram 

Iâ€™m interested in using biomimicry to help people turn visions into DAOs, projects into subDAOs, and themselves into communities. I want to help redefine how people design, develop, and grow meaningful open source communities.
- Civil Engineer (Construction Management)
- Biomimicry
- DAO Ecosystem Designer/Engineer
- Bartender
- Graphic Designer
- Wordpress (Semplice) Design/Development
- NFT Minting dApps (Polygon Network)
- Writer/Illustrator (I make web comics)
- Developer Relations (I create documentation)

## My DevRel Job Titles (The Polymath Protocol)
Below are ways I like helping freelancers and teams develop well rounded ecosystems.  10-part system serves two purposes:
1. Help teams organize their DAOs and/or subDAOs with a consistent outline to facilitate onboarding and cross-community collaboration
2. Help individuals position themselves so they can effectively add value and grow their Web3 portfolios

My aim is to use The Polymath Protocol to help you organize your ideas and present your vision so you can find a community that will help bring your ideas to life. If you are a brand/team/DAO, we'll use this framework to help you explore and grow your idea from 10 different perspectives. If you're a freelancer, we'll use this framework to identify how you can add value to existing communities using The Polymath Protocol.
