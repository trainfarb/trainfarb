## 3 Body Problem
Centralized **b9language** institutions focus on egoic **identification to alienate people from one another**.
- _Focus_ on labels to divide and conquer
- Language about _productivity_ leads to burnout
- Censorship limits _creative_ freedom

## 3 Mind Solution
Decentralized **b9language** institution that focuses on conscious **problem formulation to form strong connections**
- _Focus_ on problem formulation to transcend egoic division
- Slow _productivity_ documentation to create shared solutions
- _Creative_ models so less gets lost in translation
