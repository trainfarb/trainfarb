## Proposal (For Review) - Matic to Polygon Bridge Alternative (FAQ)
### Mission:
- Challenge: Getting MATIC tokens from an exchange onto the Polygon Network is really confusing. Traditional bridge is expensive for first timers.
- Biomimicry: How do synapses transmit information across different sections of our neural network?
- Goal: Create FAQ section for how purchase MATIC on Okcoin and send to [WALLET] to mint Horsemen tokens

### Roadmap:
- Create documentation for walkthrough in GitHub
  - Set up Okcoin
  - purchase MATIC (wait X amount of days)
  - download EF promoted wallet
  - add polygon network to the downloaded wallet
  - transfer MATIC to the wallet
  - connect wallet to minting dApp
  - purchase Free Horsemen Intro NFT (see below)
  - done
- Discuss where else documentation gets shared:
  - Gitbook?
  - Notion?
  - Medium?
  - Substack?
- Free to mint polygon NFT for people who complete the walkthrough
  - EF Designed Stamps that introduce the different characters
  - Or Jiba can do a quick/sketched comic strip for the diff characters guiding people from web3 into into the Horsemen web3 universe with EF Learning Lab documentation.

### Deliverables:
- Learning Engine Case Study as a summary
- Matic to Polygon Tutorial NFT
- URL for completed documentation
  - GitHub
  - Notion
  - Medium?
  - Substack?
- Share completed documentation to the network
  - Discord
  - Twitter
  - Instagram?
  - Medium?
  - Substack?
