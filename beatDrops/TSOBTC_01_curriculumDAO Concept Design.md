# TSOBTC curriculumDAO Concept Design
https://github.com/TheSchoolofBitcoin/curriculumDAO_CD
### Introduction & Goal
Role: DAO Ecosystem Strategy
- trainfarb: How can ourStory APIs help educators organize their ideas into a project based learning DAO?
- TSOBTC: How can learners transform the didactic portion of TSOBTC into a personalized project centered around their interests? How can TSOBTC help different teams integrate their current courses into TSOBTC?

Result: After working through this, I think a lot of teams would want help planning and adapting their own projects. This will lead into TSOBTC_02_TSOBTC RAS Program. A consulting arm for TSOBTC that's looking to enter the Stacks Residency program. We can create a business that onboards teams that contribute courses and freelancers who will help build student projects while they beef up their own portfolios.
