# DAO Concept Design
### Introduction & Goal
Role: DAO Ecosystem Strategy, Platform Design, Token Engineering
trainfarb: How can 369API help teams develop systainable economic models for their DAOs? How do people actually get DAOs started?
TSOBTC: How can TSOBTC form itself as a DAO? How can TSOBTC pay its contributors? How can learners turn their projects into careers? 

Result: After working through this, I think a lot of teams would want help planning and adapting their own projects. 
This will lead into TSOBTC_02_Tokenomics Course. A consulting arm for TSOBTC that's looking to enter the Stacks Residency program. 
We can create a business that onboards teams that contribute courses and freelancers who will help build student projects while they beef up their own portfolios.
