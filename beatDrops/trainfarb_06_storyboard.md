This is America by Childish Gambino
Belief
- I am contributing to a reality focused on maintaining a frequency of love and music
- I am aware of other frequencies that exist that will bring people out of resonance
- I am contributing to a reality that is able to have meaningful conversations without censorship
- I am contributing to a reality that acknowledges the past as a tool for mindful reflection and conscious development rather than a cancellation device
- I am contributing to a reality that removes the current censorship surrounding how rich and vibrant each person's culture is.
- "Black" or "White" is a gross over simplification of how amazing human history is. This isn't a game of chess.
- Music going from rough to smooth is how America still progresses regardless of what comes at us
- Kids growing up where bullets fly are still geniuses.
- To me, this song represents the anti-fragility of America.
- Shows how much we can achieve when we have unconsious institutions in control.
- What will happen when more of us start adding more conscious energy into clearly defined goals?
